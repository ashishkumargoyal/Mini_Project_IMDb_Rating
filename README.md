# IMDb Rating Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview:
This project aims to predict IMDb ratings of TV shows based on various features such as the movie name, genre, year of release, and number of votes. The goal is to build a machine learning model using the IMDb Top 250 dataset.

## Dataset:
- **IMDb Top 250 Shows Dataset**: The dataset includes information such as movie title, genre, release year, votes, and ratings.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models and preprocessing

## Project Steps:

1. **Data Loading, Exploration, and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and convert categorical variables like Genre using one-hot encoding.
   - Check correlations between features and ratings.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize relationships between features (e.g., votes vs ratings).
   - Plot distribution of ratings and correlations between numeric variables.
   - Analyze genre distribution and its impact on ratings.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract and categorize years into ranges.
   - One-hot encode the Genre column.
   - Drop or transform irrelevant features (e.g., Title).

4. **Dataset Splitting**:
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets.
   - Scale numeric features for model optimization.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Train and compare multiple machine learning models.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics.
   - Use residual plots for error analysis.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model parameters.

8. **Predictions and Final Model**:
   - Use the best model to make predictions on test data.
   - Compare predicted vs actual ratings.

9. **Model Interpretation and Conclusion**:
   - Interpret feature importance and model performance.
   - Compare models and provide insights for further improvements.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Cleaned and preprocessed data ready for modeling.
- Trained machine learning models and their evaluation.
- Best model identified for accurate IMDb rating prediction.
- Visualized results with insights from prediction errors.
